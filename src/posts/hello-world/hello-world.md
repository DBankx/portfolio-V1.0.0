Hello World 🌎 - I would like to briefly introduce my self in this post. My name is `Hundeyin Oluwadamilola` often called dami by my peers and colleagues and i am a full-stack web developer. I have been in this field since 2018 and i currently work as a `front-end web developer` (intern) at `Talenture Group` in Lagos, Nigeria.

I have always been fascinated by the world wide web and always dreamt that i would create applications that would help boost the efficiency of the life of people or businesses. I strongly believe that in the years to come the internet will be a necessity for each and everyone living on this blue rock. Currently the main trend of development i follow is one where web apps have become close relatives to mobile apps in terms of feel, speed, efficiency and responsiveness with new additions like `PWA` using technologies like gatsby, `react`, and some other front end frameworks.

My first ever website built was with the bare-bones `HTML & CSS` in 2013 and it was a school project for general I.T. I built this using notepad ++ and barley understood the programming in general so i left the field for quite a while because i thought it was a field for mostly geniuses and the top smart kids, But now being older and in the tech field i can happily say that was a wild misconception. `Google & stackoverflow` are my no1 tools i use in development and i think most devs will agree with me that without those most of the apps we use currently wouldnt exist 😁. As of now i currently work mostly with `JavaScript & C#` as my main languages. I mainly use Javascript for front end development with libraries like react, gatsby, jQuery and much more, and my preferred back end language and frameworks is `CSharp(C#) & Asp.Net Core`. I'm open to discussions on various new ideas and job prospects. I will try to update my blog as much as possible so that many of you can get an idea of the latest trends in technologies.
